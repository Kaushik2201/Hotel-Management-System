Here are some of Important things
> Any IDE can be used but I have used NetBeans beacuse of its easier built facility
> Path of each and every file is important
> MySQL and JAVA JDK must be installed
> I Have used external JAR Files
1. mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.jar (For Connecting JAVA with MySQL)
2. rs2xml.jar (For displaying the MySQL data)
